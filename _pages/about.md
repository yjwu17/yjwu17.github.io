### **Short Bio**
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Dr. Yujie Wu is an Assistant Professor at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). Prior to this, he was a postdoctoral researcher collaborating with Prof. Wolfgang Maass, a pioneer in brain-inspired computing, at Graz University of Technology (2021–2024). He received his Ph.D. from Tsinghua University under the supervision of Prof. Luping Shi and Prof. Jun Zhu (2016-2021).

His recent works have been published in prestigious journals and top AI conferences, including <span style="color:blue;">Nature, Science Robotics, Nature Computational Science, Nature Communications, TNNLs and AAAI</span>. Three of his publications have been selected as ESI Top 1% Highly Cited Papers. The Tianjic chip project he participated in was recognized as one of the Top 10 Sci-tech Achievements in China in 2019.
